# Pomodoro-with-camera-detect-distracted
* First the Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It is designed to improve productivity by breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are called "pomodoros," named after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.
* To increase the effectiveness of this method applied in learning and working, I suggest use a camera to monitor user's learn or work progress by use YOLOv8 detect user's distraction.
* When camera detect user out of focus to learn or work, the time of camera will stop and user can select two option: First is do some simple exercise to improve focus and second is continue the pomodoro progress
  
## How this its work?
### 1. Time countdown of Pomodoro
* Base on Pomodoro timer, we will have 25 minutes for learning/ working, 5 minutes for a short break, and after four times learning progress it will have 15 minutes for a long break time
